## 🔧 How to Play

1. **Draw Your Power Cards**  
   Shuffle and draw a number of starter cards to begin the game. Choose wisely — they’ll shape your journey.

2. **Pick a Dare Level**  
   Start at Level 1 (Vanilla) and upgrade at any time by handing over a special upgrade card. With each upgrade, new add-ons may be activated... whether you're ready or not.

3. **Unleash the Chaos**  
   Players alternate drawing dares or assigning them with their power cards. Some cards give full control. Others strip it away.

4. **Climb the Trail. Lose the Control.**  
   You choose how far to go. From flirty dares to full domination — it’s all on the trail.
