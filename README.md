# 🏕️ Kinktrails

> *Not your average trail mix.*

Kinktrails is a wilderness-inspired, kink-friendly adventure game designed for one, two… or as many brave souls as you can fit on the trail. It blends outdoor exploration, playful power dynamics, and escalating challenges into an unforgettable experience that starts with cards and ends... however you decide.

This open-source adult card game is perfect for couples, adventurous friends, or even solo hikers looking to turn up the heat in the great outdoors. Whether you're teasing yourself through a series of increasingly daring dares, surrendering control to a partner, or putting on a full kink show for a curious crew — Kinktrails adapts to your style.

Hiking alone? No problem. The game fully supports solo play with optional self-submission mechanics, creative edging challenges, and customizable dares that ensure you’ll never need an audience to break a sweat. But if you do invite others... just know things will probably get wild.

## 🔧 How to Play

1. **Draw Your Power Cards**  
   Shuffle and draw a number of starter cards to begin the game. Choose wisely — they’ll shape your journey.

2. **Pick a Dare Level**  
   Start at Level 1 (Vanilla) and upgrade at any time by handing over a special upgrade card. With each upgrade, new add-ons may be activated... whether you're ready or not.

3. **Unleash the Chaos**  
   Players alternate drawing dares or assigning them with their power cards. Some cards give full control. Others strip it away.

4. **Climb the Trail. Lose the Control.**  
   You choose how far to go. From flirty dares to full domination — it’s all on the trail.
