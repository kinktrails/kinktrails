# 🧭 How to Play Kinktrails

Kinktrails is a daring outdoor game for adventurous hikers who want to mix power play, teasing, and escalating dares into their time on the trail — all with safety, fun, and consent at the core. This guide walks you through how to prepare and play.

## 🛑 1. Set the Foundation

### 🗣️ Start with a Conversation  
Before anything else, have an open and honest chat:
- **Set boundaries**: What’s okay, what’s off-limits, and what’s maybe?
- **Pick a safeword**: Something short and easy to remember that instantly stops everything. Pro tip: “Pinecone” is a terrible safeword if you're hiking in a pine forest.
- **Agree on an exit plan**: If someone needs to end things early, how does that happen? Pause? Hike back? Whatever works — just make it clear.

> ⚠️ **Anyone can stop the game at any time. Full stop. No questions, no pressure.**

> ⚠️ **Make sure you are all very sure that you want to do it when going to the higher levels.** Especially the ones where you leave things behind...

> 🔒 **Consent is the trailhead. Don't skip it. Only continue if you're both ready.**

### ⚖️ Know the Law  
Make sure you understand and respect:
- Local laws around nudity, toys, and public behavior.
- How private (or public) your trail might be.
- The potential legal risks of doing kink outdoors.

> 👮 Stay safe. Know the rules of where you play.

> 🌒 *If in doubt, do a night hike — if you feel comfortable with that 😏*

## 🧩 2. Build Your Game Setup

There are three main types:

- **Power Cards**: These give each player unique powers — like card-stealing, dare-swapping, or instant commands. Start by selecting a number of these (even split) or go wild and take the full deck.
- **Level Cards**: Dares are sorted into escalating levels — from cheeky and playful to full-on wild. You can unlock levels as the hike goes on.
- **Add-ons**: Optional spicy rules or twists — like clothing rules, toy play, control cards, or public dares. These are enabled as the game progresses or when certain conditions are met.

> 💡 Pro Tip: Customize! You can adjust levels, rewrite dares, or skip any cards. Blank dare slots are included for your own wild ideas.

> 💡 Bonus Tip: Prep small "level bags" — each with a level card, any required items, and its add-ons. When you level up, just pull the next bag and go. No mood-killing card shuffling mid-hike!

### ⏱️ Define Dynamic Rules

You decide how the game flows:

- **Timing** – How often do you want a dare? Every 5 minutes? 10? Decide based on trail length and intensity.
- **Level Ups & Add-ons** – Level up after a set number of dares, after a specific time, or by dice rolls. Or assign someone the power to decide when it’s time to crank it up.
- **Add-on Activation** – Maybe one player gets the power to enable add-ons or you decide that together. Or maybe the person who rolls a 6 can decide if they want to upgrade...

## 🧱 3. Choose Your Levels & Add-ons

- Agree on how many **levels** you're open to reaching.
- Choose which **add-ons** are available to activate during the hike.

> 🎒 Example: If your partner takes more than 8 power cards, maybe *you* get to control when add-ons are activated. Fair's fair.

---

## 🧭 4. Pick Your Trail

Once your game rules are locked in, choose your trail:

- Look for a **trail** that matches your comfort level — from totally remote to semi-popular.
- Make sure there are **private spots** if things escalate.
- Factor in distance, terrain, daylight, and possible encounters.
- Know local regulations: Are messy activities okay? Can you go off-trail?

> 🌿 Respect nature, and don’t leave anything behind — except great memories.

## 🏕️ 5. Pack & Prepare

Essentials checklist:

- Printed & laminated cards
- Two six-sided dice
- Water, snacks, sunscreen
- Layers, cover-ups,
- Toys, cuffs, ropes (if agreed)
- Cleanup wipes or towels
- Emergency contact device (PLB, satellite messenger)
- Let someone know your trail + return time

## 🎲 6. Start the Hike & Let the Game Begin

### 🃏 Power Cards

Split power cards between players — either by alternating picks or letting one person choose first. If one person grabs them *all*, congrats — **they just became the Queen/King of the Trail**. Hand them that card immediately and prepare for a wild ride!

### 🏁 Let’s Go

Start your hike.

Based on your chosen timing:
1. Roll a die to decide who does the next dare (one of you is odd numbers, the other even).
2. Roll again to select a dare from the current level.
3. Read it out loud. Laugh nervously. And then... do it.

Repeat throughout the hike. Don’t forget to:
- Use your Power Cards.
- Level up.
- Activate those spicy Add-ons.

> 🔁 **Regular check-ins**: Pause once in a while, maybe even before each dare but definitely for each level-up and ask, “Still good?” Adjust if needed.

---

## 🧡 Aftercare & Debrief

When the hike ends:
- Sit down.
- Hydrate, eat snacks.
- Talk about what felt good, what was intense, and what you'd change.
- Laugh about the wild parts.
- Celebrate what you just pulled off — because that wasn’t just a hike, that was a full-on adventure.
