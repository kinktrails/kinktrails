# 🧭 How to Play Kinktrails

Kinktrails is a daring outdoor game for adventurous hikers who want to mix power play, teasing, and escalating dares into their time on the trail — all with safety, fun, and consent at the core. This guide walks you through how to prepare and play.

## 🛑 1. Set the Foundation

### 🗣️ Start with a Conversation  
Before anything else, have an open and honest chat:
- **Set boundaries**: What’s okay, what’s off-limits, and what’s maybe?
- **Pick a safeword**: Something short and easy to remember that instantly stops everything. Pro tip: “Pinecone” is a terrible safeword if you're hiking in a pine forest.
- **Agree on an exit plan**: If someone needs to end things early, how does that happen? Pause? Hike back? Whatever works — just make it clear.

> ⚠️ **Anyone can stop the game at any time. Full stop. No questions, no pressure.**

> ⚠️ **Make sure you are all very sure that you want to do it when going to the higher levels.** Especially the ones where you leave things behind...

> 🔒 **Consent is the trailhead. Don't skip it. Only continue if you're both ready.**

### ⚖️ Know the Law  
Make sure you understand and respect:
- Local laws around nudity, toys, and public behavior.
- How private (or public) your trail might be.
- The potential legal risks of doing kink outdoors.

> 👮 Stay safe. Know the rules of where you play.

> 🌒 *If in doubt, do a night hike — if you feel comfortable with that 😏*

## 🧩 2. Build Your Game Setup

There are three main types:

- **Power Cards**: These give each player unique powers — like card-stealing, dare-swapping, or instant commands. Start by selecting a number of these (even split) or go wild and take the full deck.
- **Level Cards**: Dares are sorted into escalating levels — from cheeky and playful to full-on wild. You can unlock levels as the hike goes on.
- **Add-ons**: Optional spicy rules or twists — like clothing rules, toy play, control cards, or public dares. These are enabled as the game progresses or when certain conditions are met.

> 💡 Pro Tip: Customize! You can adjust levels, rewrite dares, or skip any cards. Blank dare slots are included for your own wild ideas.

> 💡 Bonus Tip: Prep small "level bags" — each with a level card, any required items, and its add-ons. When you level up, just pull the next bag and go. No mood-killing card shuffling mid-hike!

### ⏱️ Define Dynamic Rules

You decide how the game flows:

- **Timing** – How often do you want a dare? Every 5 minutes? 10? Decide based on trail length and intensity.
- **Power Cards** - How do you want to play the power cards? Maybe limiting to one card per round of dares - Or go all in and allow activation without limitations and prepare for a quick escalation! 😈
- **Level Ups & Add-ons** – Level up after a set number of dares, after a specific time, or by dice rolls. Or assign someone the power to decide when it’s time to crank it up or just use the Level-up Power card.
- **Add-on Activation** – Maybe one player gets the power to enable add-ons or you decide that together. Or maybe the person who rolls a 6 can decide if they want to upgrade... Or you just choose to add the Add-On power card(s)...

### 🎮 Example Game Modes

To help you get started, here are two sample game flows:

#### 🧘‍♀️ The Gentle Ramp-Up
For hikers who want a slow burn and time to enjoy the scenery.

- **Dare Frequency:** Every 10–15 minutes or at scenic/rest points.
- **Power Cards:** Only a few in play. Maximum one per round of dares.
- **Level-Ups:** Occur after 6 dares or every 45 minutes.
- **Add-ons:** Unlocked only by mutual agreement.
- **Tone:** Playful, sensual, low pressure. Great for first-timers.

---

#### 🔥 Chaos Trail Mode
For experienced players who want intensity and unpredictability from the start.

- **Dare Frequency:** Every 5 minutes plus at trail landmarks like signs, bridge, lookouts etc.
- **Power Cards:** All cards in play. No limit in activation frequency. Play any power card at any time.
- **Level-Ups:** Triggered by dice rolls (e.g. roll a double-6 for instant level up) and using the Level-Up Power cards.
- **Add-ons:** Can be activated at any time using the Add-Ons Power cards.
- **Tone:** Fast-paced, kinky, escalating quickly. Strap in.

---

## 🧱 3. Choose Your Levels & Add-ons

- Agree on how many **levels** you're open to reaching.
- Choose which **add-ons** are available to activate during the hike.

🔍 Before you pack, browse the Add-Ons for any extra items you might need. Some Add-Ons have unique requirements — for example, the Single Piece Add-On asks each person to choose one piece of clothing they’d be comfortable hiking in (like a swimsuit).

---

## 🧭 4. Pick Your Trail

Once your game rules are locked in, choose your trail:

- Look for a **trail** that matches your comfort level — from totally remote to semi-popular.
- Make sure there are **private spots** if things escalate.
- Factor in distance, terrain, daylight, and possible encounters.
- Know local regulations: Are messy activities okay? Can you go off-trail?

> 🌿 Respect nature, and don’t leave anything behind — except great memories.

## 🏕️ 5. Pack & Prepare

Essentials checklist:

- Printed & laminated cards
- Two six-sided dice
- Water, snacks, sunscreen
- Layers, cover-ups,
- Toys, cuffs, ropes (if agreed)
- Cleanup wipes or towels
- Emergency contact device (PLB, satellite messenger)
- Let someone know your trail + return time

## 🎲 6. Start the Hike & Let the Game Begin

### 🃏 Power Cards

Split power cards between players — either by alternating picks or letting one person choose first. If one person grabs them *all*, congrats — **they just became the Queen/King of the Trail**. Hand them that card immediately and prepare for a wild ride!

### 🏁 Let’s Go

Start your hike.

Based on your chosen timing:
1. Roll a die to decide who does the next dare (one of you is odd numbers, the other even).
2. Roll again to select a dare from the current level.
3. Read it out loud. Laugh nervously. And then... do it.

Repeat throughout the hike. Don’t forget to:
- Use your Power Cards.
- Level up.
- Activate those spicy Add-ons.

> 🔁 **Regular check-ins**: Pause once in a while, maybe even before each dare but definitely for each level-up and ask, “Still good?” Adjust if needed.

### 🔌 Enabling Add-Ons

When an Add-On is activated, the person who triggered it decides who takes on which role — if the Add-On involves specific tasks or actions.  
For example, in the **Strip & Serve Add-On**, one becomes the platter. The activator chooses who.

If the Add-On was triggered by a random event (like a die roll or surprise card), and it's unclear who should take which role, simply **roll a die** to assign roles fairly.

### 🔄 Add-On Trigger Logic

| **Trigger Type**        | **Who Activates?**        | **How to Assign Roles?**                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Power Card              | Player who uses it        | That player decides                     |
| Dice Roll / Random Event| Person who triggered it   | Roll a die to assign roles fairly       |
| Level-Up                | Auto-activates previous level's Add-Ons | Use die if roles aren't clear          |

---

### ↗️ Leveling Up

When you trigger a level up — by any method you’ve chosen — all **Add-Ons from the previous level** activate **immediately**.

Use the same Add-On rule above to determine who takes on which role when the Add-On has one.

> 🔄 **Note:** Leveling up only activates the *previous* level’s Add-Ons. The new level’s Add-Ons stay locked until that they are activated properly.

---

## 🧡 Aftercare & Debrief

When the hike ends:
- Sit down.
- Hydrate, eat snacks.
- Talk about what felt good, what was intense, and what you'd change.
- Laugh about the wild parts.
- Celebrate what you just pulled off — because that wasn’t just a hike, that was a full-on adventure.
