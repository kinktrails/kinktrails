### 🧩 Extended Restraint Add-On  
**Hold tight — no quick escapes**  

- Restraint durations double or triple (e.g., 10–15 minutes instead of 5).  
- Players may be locked in more challenging positions, with greater emphasis on endurance and trust.  
- Allows for slow teasing, whispered commands, or gentle body play while restrained.
