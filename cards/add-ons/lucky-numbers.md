### 🍀 Lucky Number Rolls Add-On

Each one chooses a different lucky number from 2 to 12.
Roll two dice to select a dare.

- If the **sum = lucky number** → reroll.
- If the **reroll is not lucky** → both do the dare matching the **first die**.
- If the **reroll is lucky again** → escalate for the person having to do the dare:

**Kink Hike:**  
→ Strip
→ Get fully covered in chocolate sauce

**Extreme Kink Hike:**
→ Bound spread-eagle on trail  
→ Blindfolded & teased for 5 min  
→ Obey all commands until next roll
