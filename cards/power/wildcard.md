### 🃏 Wildcard  
**Bend the rules. Rewrite the game.**

When you draw a dare you don’t want to do, use this card to replace that dare with a custom dare of your choice.

- You create the dare on the spot or choose one from the list — your choice!
- Once used, the Wildcard passes to the other person to be used for one of their dares.

> *“Chaos is fair play… when you’re holding the Wildcard.”*
