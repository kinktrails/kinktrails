### ❄️ Frostfall Command
**The cold obeys you.**

Play this card to command the other person to enter a natural body of icy water — fully or partially, your choice. They must stay in until you say they can come out.
Clothing removal is optional, but you decide what they wear for the dip.

> "You're mine now — goosebumps, shivers, and all.”
