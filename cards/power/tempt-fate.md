### ðŸ”¥ Tempt Fate  
**Take on double dares now to raise the level for your partner later.**

Play this card on your turn. Roll twice and complete both dares.

As your reward, your partner must complete a **next-level dare** the next time itâ€™s their turn â€” even if the level hasn't officially been unlocked yet.

After your partner completes the next-level dare, pass this card to them.

> *"Burn now, and theyâ€™ll feel the heat later."*
