# 🤫 The Silencer  

Play this card to silence your partner **until the next dare roll**.  
During this time, they **may not speak**, whisper, or make intentional sounds.  
All communication must be nonverbal — gestures, facial expressions, or writing only.

**If they slip up and speak?**  
You may immediately assign **any dare** of your choice from any level you've unlocked — no dice roll, no veto.

⏳ After the 10 minutes, you must **hand this card to your partner**, who may use it later in return.
