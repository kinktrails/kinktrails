### 🎴 Assistant
**Your dare, their hands.**

Play this card when you're assigned a dare. The other player must assist you — however you choose. You can direct them, involve them physically or verbally, or just have them set the scene. They must obey within their boundaries.

After it's played, **pass it to your partner**…  

> *“Hold this. Pour that. Whisper instructions. You’re part of this now — whether you like it or not.”*
