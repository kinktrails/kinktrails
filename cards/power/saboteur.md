### 🕷️ Saboteur’s Choice  
**You choose their dare instead of the dice.**

Play immediately after your partner rolls — ignore the number and *you* pick the dare from the list.

After your sabotage is complete, pass this card to your partner (your target may get revenge...).

> *“Dice? Oh no. I’ve got *plans* for you.”*
