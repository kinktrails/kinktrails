### 📜 Surprise Dare  
**The dice know no mercy.**

Before any level upgrade, play this card and roll the dice.

🎲 Roll to determine the dare level (1–4 = fixed, 5–6 = chaos — adjust if fewer than 4 levels):

- **1–4** → A random dare from that level is chosen and must be performed by your partner.
- **5–6** → You choose any dare from any level and who must do it.

Could be soft, could be wild — it’s all in the roll.

After use, **pass this card to your partner**.

> *“Fate just rolled in… and she’s feeling playful.”*
