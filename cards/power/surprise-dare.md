# ðŸ“œ Surprise Dare

Before any level upgrade, play this card and roll the dice.

ðŸŽ² Roll to determine the dare level (1â€“4 = fixed, 5â€“6 = chaos - Adjust if less than 4 levels):

- Roll 1â€“4: A random dare from that level is chosen and must be performed by the other person.
- Roll 5 or 6: You get to choose any dare from the full list, at any level, and choose who must do it.

Could be soft, could be wild â€” itâ€™s all in the roll. Passes after use.
