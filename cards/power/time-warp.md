### ⏳ Time Warp  
**The mischievous cousin of a Veto card.**

Don’t like the current dare? Skip it — easy!  
But when your turn comes around again, you **must** face a dare from the *next* level.

You don’t level up yet — just take a taste of what’s to come.

Once you complete that next-level dare, **pass this card to your partner** and watch them squirm when they try the same trick.

> *“Dodge now, pay later.”*
