### ⏳ Time Warp
*the mischievous cousin of a Veto card*

Don’t like the current dare at all? No problem! Just skip it!  
But there’s a twist… when your turn comes up *next time*, you **have to** tackle a dare rolled from the *next* level instead!  

You don’t level up yet — just face a bigger challenge when you thought you were off the hook.  

Once you complete that next-level dare, pass this card to your partner and watch the fun continue!
