### 🎭 Power Card: Split Decision  
**Two dares, two victims — you decide who gets what.**

When it's your partner's turn, roll two dares instead of one.  
*You* get to assign one dare to yourself and the other to your partner.  
You both must complete your chosen dares immediately — no swaps once picked.

After both dares are done, hand this card over.

> *“Shared mischief. Divided consequences.”*
