### 🎲 Dare Swap  
**Flip the script — your dare, their move!**

After a dare is revealed (but before it’s done), play this card to swap who must do it.

- If it was part of a Double Trouble dare, both get assigned to that person.

After use, **pass it to your partner** to keep the twists coming.

> *“Why should they have all the fun? Let’s shake things up!”*
