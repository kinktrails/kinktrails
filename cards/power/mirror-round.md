### 🔄 Mirror Round  
**You dare? We *both* do. No escaping it now.**

Play this before the next dare roll. Whatever the dice say — it’s a shared fate.  
If one of you gets a wild task, the other’s coming along for the ride.

Once both of you complete the mirrored dare, pass the card on.

> *“If I'm going down, you're going down with me… giggling all the way.”*
