### 🕶️ Blind Trust  
**No peeking, no planning — just feeling your way through...**

Play this card before the next dare is drawn.  
Whoever does the dare must complete it **fully blindfolded** — no matter what it is.

After it's played, **pass it to your partner**…  

> *“Close your eyes. Now let the trail — and your partner — lead the way.”*
