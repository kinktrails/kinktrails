### 👕 Take Off a Clothing  
**One piece down — and the fun’s just starting!**

Draw this card and the other person must immediately remove one piece of clothing — no questions asked.

- No dodging, no delaying. Strip it off right then and there.  
- Socks don’t count. Nice try. 😉

After use, pass this card to the other player.

> *“Less is more — at least when the game calls for it.”*
