### 🎲 Spite Roll

If someone plays a Power Card on you, you can roll a die in response:

    1: Very unlucky! They choose one element to spice up!
    2-3: Too bad! Take it.
    4-5: You choose one element to change.
    6: You reverse the card effect — they now do it instead.

> Risky revenge — but oh so satisfying when it lands.
