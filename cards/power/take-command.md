### 🔥 Take Command  
**For 30 minutes, you're the game master.**

You're in charge for the next 30 minutes:

- Decide the dares, the rules, the flow.
- Guide the energy, set the tone, and push boundaries (gently or boldly).
- After time is up, **pass this card to your partner** — it's their turn to take control next.
