### ⚡ Chaos Card: Clothes Swap Chaos ⚡
**Walk a mile in someone else’s… outfit.**

Immediately swap all your clothes with your partner — everything.

You must keep the swapped clothes on until a dare or power card tells you otherwise. No refusals.

And yes, that can be used to get clothed again and getting them naked! 😈

‼️This card is then removed from the game! It does not pass and can not be used again!

> *“Chaos isn’t just a moment—it’s a state of dress”*
