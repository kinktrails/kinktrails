# 🎴 Kinktrails – Dare Cards

Welcome to the **Kinktrails Cards** folder — this is where the core gameplay lives. The cards guide your progression through fun, flirtation, kink, and surrender, plus optional power twists and spicy add-ons.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

This directory is organized into three subfolders:

### `/levels`
The main progression cards. Each level builds on the last — from playful night hikes to full surrender modes. Start here.

### `/add-ons`
Optional twists you can enable once a level allows it. Add-ons modify the base game: new rules, wardrobe limits, extra ingredients, public risk, and more.

### `/power`
These cards shift the power dynamic. One person takes more control, or both enter into a deeper mutual agreement. Can be used alone or layered onto a level.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Cards

1. **Start with a Level**: Choose an entry point from `/levels`. Print that card front and back.
2. **Optional: Add Add-Ons**: Only use add-ons when the current level allows them.
3. **Optional: Choose Power Cards**: If you want to add a dominant/submissive or control element, use a power card.

## 🧩 Modularity = Freedom

All cards are modular and mixable, but **respect level boundaries** unless all players consent to customization. The structure is here for safety and fun.

- Want a light hike? Stick to Level 1 with no add-ons.
- Want to go wild? Work your way up to Level 5 with add-ons and power twists.

## 🛡️ Consent is the Only Rule

Cards don't replace communication. If something feels off — pause, talk, or stop completely.  
You're playing for fun, intimacy, and mutual exploration.
