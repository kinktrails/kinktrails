## 🍫 Level 2: Night Hike Dare Game – Chocolate Twist

Still playful, still non-kinky — but now with a delicious reward.  
A little spice, no heat. 🌶️  
The final treat? One person becomes the **chocolate fruit buffet** at the summit!

---

### 🎲 How the Dare Game Works

Every 10 minutes during the hike:

- Roll 1 die:  
  - **Even** → The roller performs the dare  
  - **Odd** → The other person performs the dare  
- Then roll again to select a dare from the list below:

1. Create a funny walk  
2. Lights out for 1 minute — continue hiking in the dark if comfortable  
3. Share a secret, embarrassing story, or guilty pleasure (bonus if hiking-related)  
4. Find and describe a weird rock or stick like it's a priceless artifact  
5. Get decorated with leaves or nature-themed accessories by the other person  
6. Blindfolded object identification challenge
