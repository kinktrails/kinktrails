## 🟢 Level 1: Non-Kinky Night Hike Dare Game

Just playful and fun! A light-hearted mix of dares to keep us laughing under the stars.

### 🎲 How the Dare Game Works

Every 10 minutes during the hike:

- Roll 1 die:  
  - **Even** → The roller performs the dare  
  - **Odd** → The other person performs the dare  
- Then roll again to select a dare from the list below:

1. Create a funny walk  
2. Lights out for 1 minute — try walking without light if you feel safe  
3. Share a secret, embarrassing story, or guilty pleasure (bonus if hiking-related)  
4. Find & describe a weird rock or stick like it's the most amazing thing you've ever seen in your life 
5. Get decorated by the other with leaves or natural accessories  
6. Blindfolded object identification
