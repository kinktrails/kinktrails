Want to take Kinktrails into the wild? Here's how to print and prepare your deck for trail-ready play.

## 📄 1. Choose What to Print

Start by selecting and downloading the card sets you want to bring:

- **Power Cards** – The dynamic game-changers.
- **Level Cards** – The dares, grouped by intensity.
- **Add-ons** – Optional twists and mechanics.
- **Reference Sheets (optional)** – Quick rules or cheat-sheets for on-the-go clarification.

## ✂️ 2. Format & Layout

For best results:

- Use the provided **PDFs** or layout the Markdown-based cards into printable pages.
- Print on **thick paper** or **cardstock** (around 200–250gsm).
- Use **landscape orientation**.
- Print of both sides of the page if possible while roating on the short sides of the page.

## 💧 3. Laminate for Trail Durability

Optional but highly recommended:

- Laminate all cards using a standard laminator or self-adhesive laminating sheets.
- Cut out each card *before* laminating for a proper, full seal.
- Use rounded corners to avoid poking holes in your backpack or poking your hiking buddy.

> 🌧️ Laminated cards won’t soak, smudge, or tear when things get hot, wet, or wild.

## 👜 4. Organize for Quick Access

Suggestions for storage:

- Use **small zipper bags** or **rubber bands** to group:
  - Power Cards
  - Each Level + associated Add-ons
- Consider prepping **"level bags"** — each containing the items, dares, and rules needed for a specific level. Makes leveling up a breeze!

## 🎒 5. Pack Light, Pack Right

When you're done printing and prepping:

- Store your decks in a compact box or pouch.
- Only bring what you need for **that** hike.
- Leave heavier or unused add-ons at home if you’re trying a shorter or lighter version of the game.

> 🧡 You can always expand later!

## 🖍️ 6. Customize & Make It Yours

There are blank templates included — feel free to:

- Write your own dares
- Add personal twists to existing ones
- Decorate or color-code levels and cards

Let the deck evolve with you and your partner’s dynamic.
